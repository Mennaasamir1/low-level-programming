A singly linked list (SLL) is a linear data structure used to store a sequence of elements (called nodes) where each node points to the next one in the sequence.

Unlike arrays that store elements in contiguous memory locations, a singly linked list stores each element independently in memory and connects them using pointers.

ðŸ”‘ Structure of a Node

Each node in a singly linked list has two parts:

Data field â€“ stores the actual data (e.g., an integer, a string, etc.).

Pointer (next) â€“ stores the memory address of the next node in the list.
