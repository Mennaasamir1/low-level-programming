ðŸŸ¢ Definition

A Doubly Linked List is a sequence of nodes where each node stores:

 - Data â€“ the actual value you care about.

 - A pointer to the next node (next).

 - A pointer to the previous node (prev).

 - So each node has two links


 ðŸŸ© Key Operations Youâ€™ll Learn

Insertion

    At beginning

    At end

    After/before a given node

    Deletion

    From beginning

    From end

    Specific node by value or position

    Traversal

    Forward traversal (head â†’ tail)

    Backward traversal (tail â†’ head)

    Search

    Reverse (very easy in DLL because of prev)

ðŸŸ¢ Advantages

    Can be traversed in both directions.

    Easier to delete a node if we have a pointer to it (no need to find the previous node first).

    More flexible for certain data structures (like Deques, Undo/Redo stacks).

ðŸ”´ Disadvantages

    Uses more memory because of the extra pointer.

    Slightly more complex to implement.

    A bit slower for insertions because you need to update two pointers (prev and next) instead of just one.
